# DNS Setup Guide - Point menutecaapp.com to Netlify

## Current Situation

‚úÖ **Your Netlify deployment is working!**
- Netlify URL: `https://68e148f9a82e51b5b56506dc--menuteca.netlify.app`
- Production URL configured: `https://menutecaapp.com`

‚ùå **Problem:**
- Your domain `menutecaapp.com` is currently pointing to Squarespace
- DNS records need to be updated to point to Netlify instead

## Solution: Update DNS Records

### Step 1: Find Where Your Domain is Registered

Your domain `menutecaapp.com` is registered with a domain registrar. Common ones are:
- GoDaddy
- Namecheap
- Google Domains
- Cloudflare
- etc.

**Action:** Log in to your domain registrar's website.

### Step 2: Access DNS Settings

1. Find the DNS management section (usually called):
   - "DNS Management"
   - "DNS Settings"
   - "Name Servers"
   - "Domain Settings"

2. Look for your current DNS records

### Step 3: Update DNS Records for Netlify

You have two options:

#### **Option A: Use Netlify's DNS (Recommended)**

This is the easiest and most reliable method.

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/menuteca/settings/domain
   - Click on "Set up Netlify DNS"
   - Follow the wizard

2. **In Your Domain Registrar:**
   - Change name servers to Netlify's:
     ```
     dns1.p05.nsone.net
     dns2.p05.nsone.net
     dns3.p05.nsone.net
     dns4.p05.nsone.net
     ```
   - Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

#### **Option B: Use External DNS (Current Setup)**

Keep your current DNS provider but point records to Netlify.

**For root domain (menutecaapp.com):**

Delete existing A records pointing to Squarespace, then add:
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5
TTL: 3600
```

**For www subdomain (www.menutecaapp.com):**

Delete existing CNAME pointing to Squarespace, then add:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: menuteca.netlify.app
TTL: 3600
```

### Step 4: Verify DNS Configuration

After updating DNS:

1. **Check DNS propagation:**
   - Visit: https://dnschecker.org
   - Enter: `menutecaapp.com`
   - Check if it points to Netlify's IP: `75.2.60.5`

2. **Wait for propagation:**
   - DNS changes can take 1-48 hours
   - Usually completes within a few hours

3. **Test your site:**
   - Visit: `https://menutecaapp.com`
   - You should see your Menuteca app instead of Squarespace

### Step 5: Configure HTTPS in Netlify

Once DNS is pointing to Netlify:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/menuteca/settings/domain
2. Netlify will automatically provision an SSL certificate
3. HTTPS will be enabled (may take a few minutes)

## Quick Test While Waiting for DNS

You can test your deployed app immediately using the unique Netlify URL:

**Test URL:** `https://68e148f9a82e51b5b56506dc--menuteca.netlify.app`

This URL always works and shows your latest deployment.

## Troubleshooting

### "Still seeing Squarespace after 24 hours"

**Check these:**

1. **Verify DNS records are correct:**
   ```bash
   dig menutecaapp.com
   # Should show 75.2.60.5
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
   - Or use incognito mode

3. **Check Netlify domain settings:**
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/menuteca/settings/domain
   - Ensure `menutecaapp.com` is listed as primary domain
   - Check for any warnings or errors

### "DNS doesn't propagate"

**Possible issues:**

1. **Name servers not updated:**
   - Verify in your domain registrar that name servers are correct
   - If using Option B, verify A and CNAME records are correct

2. **Registrar lock:**
   - Some registrars have a domain lock feature
   - Check if your domain is locked and unlock it temporarily

3. **TTL is too high:**
   - Old DNS records may have high TTL (Time To Live)
   - Wait for the TTL period to expire
